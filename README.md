# BitDepth_NucSeg
This repository contains a fully annotated nuclei segmentation dataset of 8-bit and 16-bits fluorescence Dapi stained microscopic images from 5 human organs at a fixed size of 512x512 pixels.

## Citation
A paper describing our dataset and methodology to compare the instance segmentation performance of 8-bit vs. 16-bit fluorescence Dapi stained microscopic images is submitted to the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2021) and currently is under review. The following BibTex entry will be updated soon.
